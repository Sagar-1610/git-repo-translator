        In some fruits, the sepals, petals, stamens or the style of the flower
        fall away as the fleshy fruit ripens. However, for simple fruits derived
        from an inferior ovary – i.e., one that lies below the attachment of
        other floral parts – there are parts (including petals, sepals, and
        stamens) that fuse with the ovary and ripen with it. For such a case,
        when floral parts other than the ovary form a significant part of the
        fruit that develops, it is called an accessory fruit. Examples of
        accessory fruits include apple, rose hip, strawberry, and pineapple.
