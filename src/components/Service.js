        A fruit results from the fertilizing and maturing of one or more
        flowers. The gynoecium, which contains the stigma-style-ovary system, is
        centered in the flower-head, and it forms all or part of the fruit.[9]
        Inside the ovary(ies) are one or more ovules. Here begins a complex
        sequence called double fertilization: a female gametophyte produces an
        egg cell for the purpose of fertilization.[10] (A female gametophyte is
        called a megagametophyte, and also called the embryo sac.) After double
        fertilization, the ovules will become seeds
